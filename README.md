# simplecounter

simplecounter, is a jQuery plugin which generates a simple countdown to a given date and/or time.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Please make sure you have an up to date copy of jQuery installed.

```
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js"integrity="sha256-3edrmyuQ0w65f8gfBsqowzjJe2iM6n0nKciPUp8y+7E="crossorigin="anonymous"></script> 
```
The code above was grabbed from here [1]https://code.jquery.com/

Note I have included the code with cross origin and integrity, this is always recomended for any external resource.

### Installing

To install and run download the dist/simplecount.js file and include this after you have included jQuery.

Say what the step will be

```
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js"integrity="sha256-3edrmyuQ0w65f8gfBsqowzjJe2iM6n0nKciPUp8y+7E="crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<script src="/local/path/to/simplecount.js"></script>
  
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
